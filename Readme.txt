Hello,
for my q1 the supression works perfectly but its a really slow implementations, so when you change the threshold value with the slider wait for about 7 seconds for everything to change. The supression being slow affects the thresholding window and causes the windows to not respond, but after a couple of seconds they should clear up and show the right answer
